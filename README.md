## Business Understanding
Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to travel in a more unique, personalized way. As part of the Airbnb Inside initiative, this dataset describes the listing activity of homestays in Seattle, WA.

In this project, we will use the datasets available on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle 

Let's answer 3 business questions:

- Where is the busiest in Seattle?
- What is the distribution of properties in the city limits?
- What are the main factors that affect booking prices?.

## Resources used in development:
 - matplotlib==3.6.2
 - seaborn==0.12.2
 - pandas==1.5.2
 - numpy==1.25.1
 - scikit-learn==1.2.0
 - folium==0.14.0
 - jupyterlab==3.5.2

## Conclusion

### Question 1: 
![Count Zipcode](images/zipcode.png)
Top 5 areas which have the highest number of Airbnb properties in Seattle are: 98122, 98103, 98102, 98105, 98109. They all in the center of Seattle and near Lake Washington where has the most convenient transportation.

We can clearly see that most of the listings are concetrated in central areas (Broadway) and Belltown.

### Question 3: 
![Count Zipcode](images/features_importance.png)
 - The modelling also shows us that factors already mentioned above have influence on price: time of the year, location, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, beds and accomodates;
 - The host qualities are important: number of hostâ€™s listings, number of years since being the host, time in which the host responds to the inquiries;
 - The pricing might depend on reviews: number of reviews and review scores.
